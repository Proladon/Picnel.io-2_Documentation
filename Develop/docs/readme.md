# Quick Start

## STEP.1 Open main folder
First open a folder where the file you want to classify is located.
There are two ways to directly drag the folder into the file preview area or choose to use the folder upload button in the status bar below.

## STEP.3 Create folder link
First select a group, which will determine which group the folder will be added to; then click the `ADD Folder` button above.
You can also use drag or drop button to import the folder, but it should be noted that the upload button currently only supports single folder upload, and there must be at least one file in the folder.
The imported folder is called "Target Folder".

## STEP.4 Copy/Move Files
Each of the newly created `Target Folder` objects will have their own `C (Copy)` / `M (Move)` buttons.
Select one of the buttons to perform the corresponding operation on the file currently displayed in the preview.
After performing the operation, the `Event Logger` under the file preview area will also record the corresponding event.
